# Bookmarks API

## Description

This repository houses a bookmarks API built using Nest.js, designed as a learning resource to guide you through core Nest.js concepts. Following a step-by-step tutorial, we dive into routing, controllers, services, dependency injection, and more, culminating in a functional bookmarks API from scratch.

Please note that while the tutorial does not strictly adhere to the repository pattern, particularly in terms of database interactions being included in the service layer (where only bussiness logic should be in included), I have chosen to implement this pattern based on my understanding of the repository pattern in Nest.js.

## Technologies

- **Nest.js:** A powerful Node.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Docker:** A platform for packaging and deploying applications consistently across environments.
- **PostgreSQL:** A robust relational database management system for storing and managing data.
- **Passport.js:** An authentication middleware for Node.js, simplifying user authentication and authorization flows.
- **Prisma:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that streamlines database interactions and data modeling.
- **Pactum:** A testing library for API contract testing, ensuring expected behavior is adhered to.
- **dotenv:** A Node.js module for securely managing environment variables, keeping sensitive information out of source code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A Docker installation (`docker run hello-world` should work).
